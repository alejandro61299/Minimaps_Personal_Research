# Minimaps Research 

## Theory about minimaps

### What is a minimap?

Minimap is an UI element of the HUD usually located in a corner of the screen. It shows a abstracted view from the bird’s eye perspective of the playfield where the gameplay is being developed on a smaller scale. Its main objective is to help orientate the player and help them successfully navigate the environment to points of interest and objectives.

### When is a minimap necessary?

This question has a different answer depending on the genre and the pillars of the video game but in general the main problems that make the minimap a necessity are:

-  The playfield is large
-  There are multiple ways to reach the same destination (No linear game)
-  There are lots of different points of interest
-  The game requires [macro management](https://gamemakers.com/micro-vs-macro-consolepc-vs-mobile-gaming/) ( RTS )

In order to solve these problems **one of the several options** is to implement a minimap. Other options are in-game elements like arrows or the famous compas buts this elements are not compatible with most genres.

### Where should we place the mini map?


As we can verify each genre of video game has a distinctive position on the screen, a different visible surface size (also called minimap scope).

-   **MOBA games**  place the mini map exclusively at the  **bottom.**
-   **Strategy games** use mostly the **bottom left** but most **RTS** use  **top right.**  .
-   **MMORPG’s games**  place exclusively at the  **right** and mostly at the **top.**
-   **Racing games**  use predominantly the  **bottom**  like GPS's.
-   **FPS games**  use also mainly the  **left** for placing the mini map.

The **scope** of the mini maps differs per genre: Action, Shooter and Role-playing games show only a limited field of view including your immediate surroundings (or your current sector), whereas in Sports, MOBA and Vehicle simulation games, the mini map functions as a miniaturized world map
