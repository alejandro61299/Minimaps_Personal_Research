## Theory about minimaps
### What is a minimap?
Minimaps are an element of the HUD usually located in a corner of the screen. These are a representation of the map where the gameplay is being developed on a smaller scale. Its main objective is to guide the player and give him information that he does not have in sight or is difficult to see in his viewport.

The elements that show the minimaps vary depending on video game genre but in general tend to indicate allied, enemy and important neutral entities, relevant buildings, interest sites, etc.
